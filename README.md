# byticular

### A platform for better coding tests. :metal:

byticular (as in bytes + particular) is a side project born out of one student's (mine) dissatisfaction with the ways in which coding tests are conducted in schools. It's meant to make it easier for instructors to assess students and for students to experience a means of being tested that goes beyond freestyle assignments.

## Dev Setup

Follow these steps to recreate my setup:

1.  Clone the repository.

        git clone https://github.com/blessedzulu/byticular.git

2.  Install the Node modules in your local repository. (Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://www.nodejs.org) and npm installed, obviously.)

        npm install

3.  Start the dev server

        npm start

4.  Have fun tinkering around. Watch this repository to keep track of development.
